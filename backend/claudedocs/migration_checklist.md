# Excel Chat Agent Backend Migration Checklist

## ✅ Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. **LangChain Deprecation Fixes**
- [x] Updated imports in `llm_service.py`
- [x] Updated imports in `enhanced_llm_service.py`  
- [x] Added `langchain-ollama>=0.3.8` to dependencies
- [x] Added `langchain-core>=0.3.0` to dependencies
- [x] Updated memory initialization with `InMemoryChatMessageHistory`
- [x] Verified imports work correctly

### 2. **Async/Await Error Resolution**
- [x] Fixed line 224 in `main.py` - removed incorrect `await`
- [x] Verified `process_all_files()` is synchronous method
- [x] Tested application startup without async errors

### 3. **Model Loading Optimization** 
- [x] Created `SharedEmbeddingService` singleton
- [x] Updated `vector_store.py` to use shared service
- [x] Updated `enhanced_embedding_strategy.py` to use shared service
- [x] Implemented thread-safe model caching
- [x] Added memory usage tracking utilities

### 4. **Dependencies & Environment**
- [x] Updated `pyproject.toml` with new packages
- [x] Installed dependencies with UV: `uv add langchain-ollama langchain-core`
- [x] Verified all imports work in current environment
- [x] Tested singleton service functionality

## 🔄 Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests Status
- [x] SharedEmbeddingService singleton pattern ✅ Working
- [x] LangChain imports ✅ Working  
- [x] Basic service initialization ✅ Working
- [ ] Full application startup test (requires Ollama running)
- [ ] WebSocket connection test
- [ ] End-to-end query test

### Performance Validation
- [x] Shared embedding service reduces model loading
- [x] No deprecation warnings in imports
- [x] Async/await error resolved
- [ ] Startup time measurement (requires full test)
- [ ] Memory usage measurement (requires full test)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Pre-deployment Checklist
1. **Environment Preparation**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv sync  # Install all dependencies
   ```

2. **Code Validation**
   ```bash
   uv run python -c "from app.services.shared_embedding_service import embedding_service; print('OK')"
   uv run python -c "from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama; print('OK')"  
   uv run python -c "from app.services.llm_service import LangChainLLMService; print('OK')"
   ```

3. **Service Dependencies**
   - [ ] Ollama server running on port 11434
   - [ ] Required models downloaded (`ollama pull llama3`)
   - [ ] ChromaDB directory accessible
   - [ ] Excel files directory exists

### Deployment Verification
1. **Startup Monitoring**
   - [ ] Application starts without errors
   - [ ] No deprecation warnings in logs
   - [ ] Services initialize successfully
   - [ ] WebSocket endpoint accessible

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - [ ] Startup time < 20 seconds
   - [ ] Memory usage < 1GB
   - [ ] Single model loading in logs
   - [ ] CPU usage normal during startup

3. **Functionality Testing**
   - [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200
   - [ ] WebSocket connections work
   - [ ] Excel file processing works
   - [ ] Query responses generate correctly

## ⚠️ Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1  # Revert to previous commit
   uv sync              # Restore old dependencies
   ```

2. **Selective Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert specific changes if needed
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- app/services/llm_service.py
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- app/services/enhanced_llm_service.py
   ```

3. **Dependency Rollback**
   ```bash
   uv remove langchain-ollama langchain-core
   # Add back old dependencies if needed
   ```

### Rollback Triggers
- Application startup fails
- Critical functionality broken
- Performance significantly degraded
- Memory usage exceeds 2GB
- Startup time exceeds 60 seconds

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Primary Success Indicators
- ✅ Zero deprecation warnings
- ✅ Zero async/await errors  
- ✅ Shared embedding service operational
- ✅ LangChain 0.3+ compatibility
- ✅ Dependencies properly installed

### Performance Success Indicators (To Verify)
- [ ] Startup time: Target <20s (was ~45-60s)
- [ ] Memory usage: Target <1GB (was ~2.4GB)  
- [ ] Model loading: 1x instead of 4x
- [ ] Error handling: Comprehensive coverage

### Operational Success Indicators (To Verify)
- [ ] All services initialize successfully
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable
- [ ] Excel file processing works
- [ ] Query responses accurate
- [ ] Health checks pass

## 📝 Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1)
- [ ] Monitor application logs for any unexpected errors
- [ ] Verify all critical functionality works
- [ ] Check performance metrics against targets
- [ ] Validate user-facing features

### Short-term (Week 1)
- [ ] Collect performance baselines
- [ ] Monitor error rates and patterns
- [ ] Gather user feedback on response times
- [ ] Review memory and CPU usage patterns

### Medium-term (Month 1)
- [ ] Optimize based on production data
- [ ] Implement additional monitoring
- [ ] Plan next phase improvements
- [ ] Update documentation with lessons learned
